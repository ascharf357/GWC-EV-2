        The Flint Water Crisis
      </h2>

      <p>
        The water crisis in Flint Michigan began in 2014. The self-serving
        decision to switch the drinking water supply from Detroit's system to
        the Flint River continues to create fatal health conditions to thousands
        of its residents. During the first year of the switch, citizens reported
        a strong and distateful smell of the water. The contamination causing
        skin rashes and hair loss. These complaints were pushed aside by
        numerous city and state officals. As studies arose, it became clear the
        people of Flint Michigan were unknowingly exposing themselves to
        contamined water that would triple the blood lead levels in hundreds of
        children. Previously, the Flint river served as an unofficial location
        for the disposal of waste from nearby industries. The failure of the EPA
        to act on this issue drove the residents to act in court. Despite the
        current silence, the investigation on this issue continues to this day.

        Vernon's Exide Plant
      </h2>

      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->
        In 2015, state regulators detected posionous lead levels located in
        Vernon. These dangerous toxins were produced by Exide Technologies'
        battery recycling plant located within the region. Exide had been
        responsible for melting down lead-acid car batteries for three decades,
        despite studies that indicated clear air pollution and waste violations.
        Exide later initiated a cleanup, one which covered less than quarter of
        the contaminated land. Uncoincidentally, the community that is being
        exposed to these toxins are mostly working-class latinx residents.
        Countless attempts for decontamination have been delayed or halted
        altogether. As of 2020, only 1500 of the 8,500 infected homes have been
        successfully cleaned.

        Louisianaâ€™s Cancer Alley
      </h2>

      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->

        "Robert Taylor told reporters his community was the lowest-hanging
        fruit, and they were okay 'with just wiping us out.'" Cancer alley is a
        85 mile-long stretch of land lined with oil refiners and pertrochemical
        plants, with The area housing predominantly low-income black and
        hispanic Individuals. The plants shadow the neighboring communities with
        The sounds of machinery and pugnent smells becoming a usual occurence.
        The chemicals released at night rain like yellow raindrops. The toxicity
        and pollution produced by these plants have created alarming statistics:
        Citizens living in Cancer Alley are 50 times as likely to get cancer
        than the average American. As of March 2020, the EPA almost completely
        suspended enforcement on environmental laws due to the rise of Covid-19.
        As a result, Cancer Alley death rates have risen drastically.
